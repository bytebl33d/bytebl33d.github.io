Hi, I'm 0xSerpent — a software and cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep interest in building robust software, understanding networks, and exploring the ever-evolving landscape of digital security. My journey into this field began during my studies, where I discovered a love for coding, solving complex problems, and securing systems.

In my free time, you'll often find me sharpening my skills through CTF competitions or platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe, where I tackle real-world challenges and hone my expertise.

This blog is my space to dive into the world of cybersecurity and software development. You'll find content covering:
- Web security insights

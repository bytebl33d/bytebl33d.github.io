During my studies I developed an
interest in software development, networking and cyber security. In my free time I like to participate in CTF competitions and upskill on platforms like HackTheBox and TryHackMe. 

On this blog, I will explore different topics within cybersecurity and software development. In particular, expect many posts about web security, exploitation, CTF write-ups and some networking.

If you have any comments, feedback, or questions about this blog, feel free to contact me.

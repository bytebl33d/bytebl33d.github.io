Iâ€™m a software and cyber security enthousiast with a drive to create innovative and secure applications. In my free time I like to participate in Capture The Flag events and experiment on my home lab.

On this blog, I will explore different topics within cybersecurity and software development. In particular, expect many posts about web security, exploitation, CTF write-ups and some networking.

If you have any comments, feedback, or questions about this blog, feel free to contact me.

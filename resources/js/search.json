To better understand these products it is beneficial to create your own detection lab. In this post, I will go over the practical steps to improve my current lab setup to add Microsoft Defender for Endpoint as our EDR solution."]},{"l":"Setting Up MDE","p":["Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is a comprehensive endpoint security solution that helps protect enterprise networks from advanced threats. Setting up a home lab for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint allows individuals to gain hands-on experience in deploying, configuring, and managing this powerful security tool in a simulated environment. Onboarding your devices with MDE enables you to identify and stop threats quickly, prioritize risks, and evolve your defenses across operating systems and network devices.","In order to onboard devices with MDE, you need to have a tenant in Microsoft Entra. In case you already have an active tenant (e.g. tenant-name.onmicrosoft.com), we can activate a MDE license in the Microsoft 365 admin center. In the navigation pane, expand Billing, and select Your products. I chose for the Defender for Endpoint Plan 2 as it includes full EDR features, advanced hunting, automatic investigations and remediations, automatic attack disruption and live response."]},{"l":"Onboarding Devices","p":["Once your license has been activated, you should have a new section on the Microsoft Defender portal to manage your devices. At the moment it will look quite empty.","Go ahead and click on Onboard devices, which should bring you to a page to download onboarding packages for each device type. For my first device, I will select the Windows Server 2019, 2022, and 2025 package, and choose the streamlined local script deployment.","We can then run the onboarding script on one of our servers. And yes I know it is quite ironic, but I used Evil-WinRM to onboard my device. A subtle reminder that even “evil” tools can have a redemption arc.","After running the script, we should have a new device showing up in our inventory."]},{"l":"Making Device Groups","p":["Before we continue and try to execute any attacks, lets first make a new device group for our lab so that we can configure how we want automated investigation and remediation to proceed. Since we are testing the automated response capabilities, I want to always require approval before remediation. On the Settings page, under Permissions, select Device groups and add a new device group.","Then under the Devices section, I made a rule to match all endpoints that end with the domain \"ninja.lan\", which is one of the Ludus ranges we build in a previous blog post. Since we are testing the detection capabilities of our future attacks, I set the automation level to \"No automated response\"."]},{"l":"Testing Detection Capabilities","p":["To test our new EDR, let's assume we've gained sa access to a MSSQL server. Let's execute a simple command with the xp_cmdshell stored procedure.","In this case, the database is running as NT AUTHORITY\\Network Service. Over in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, we can see the corresponding process creation event:","At this point, nothing is particularly suspicious. We’re technically just using built-in MSSQL functionality, and since xp_cmdshell is a legitimate feature, it doesn't always trigger an immediate \"High\" severity alert. Let's step it up a notch and try to run a few more commands.","Since we’re running as a service account, we often inherit spicy local privileges that pair very nicely with classic Potato attacks. So naturally, the next logical move is to try uploading a Netcat binary to the target, because subtlety is overrated.","As expected, this attempt gets immediately nuked by MDE. The binary is signatured, Defender clocked it instantly, and the dream is over before it even started. The file was deleted before it could even be executed.","Let’s pivot to something a little more stealthy and use a custom reverse PowerShell cradle.","This PowerShell cradle is a small adaptation to one of the public cradles on PayloadAllTheThings to avoid basic AMSI triggers.","And just like that we got a reverse shell without being blocked by MDE. While Defender didn’t stop the execution, it definitely noticed the behavior. Sure enough, we can see the resulting alerts and telemetry in the Defender portal:","We can see the exact Base64 command line, the network connection to the attacker IP, and the subsequent commands run inside the shell."]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["Microsoft Defender for Endpoint is undeniably a strong security product. As demonstrated, it is highly effective at detecting and outright blocking known threats, particularly those that rely on well-known tooling, static signatures and behavioral analysis. However, as this lab also shows, detection does not always equate to prevention. When attackers adapt their techniques and move toward custom or living-off-the-land approaches, MDE may allow execution while still generating telemetry and alerts.","This highlights an important takeaway: MDE is not a silver bullet. With sufficient adaptation, creativity, and an understanding of how detections work, it is entirely possible to bypass certain protections. That does not make MDE ineffective, it simply reinforces the reality that endpoint security is an ongoing cat-and-mouse game rather than a solved problem.","In the next post, we’re going deeper. I’ll demonstrate how to bypass MDE’s behavioral engines using a custom Sliver stager and analyze the resulting artifacts in the Advanced Hunting console. Stay tuned!"]}],[{"l":"Building a Cyber Range with Ludus","p":["Ever since I built my first homelab, I wanted to create my own dedicated cyber range - my little digital playground where I can break things, fix things, automate things, and then do it all over again. True definition of insanity right here. But I didn’t want to risk nuking my daily-driver machine.","Then one day I looked over at my ancient desktop — the one that wheezes when you open up more than three Chrome tabs (I actually needed to replace a few faulty fans) and thought:","\"Bestie, you’re getting a glow-up.\"","A quick dive into the documentation rabbit hole later, I found Ludus, an open-source framework that basically said, \"I heard you hate clicking through installers manually, let me cook.\""]},{"l":"Why Ludus?","p":["I chose Ludus for a few reasons:","It automates the heavy lifting of cyber range creation, because I am allergic to unnecessary clicking.","It supports modular “plugins,” including prebuilt Active Directory environments.","Everything is infrastructure-as-code, which means I can tear down and rebuild environments cleanly.","It's built for learning, research, and “I wonder what happens if—” moments, not production use.","Besides, I was already making use of Proxmox in my previous series and Ludus builds on top of it. So Ludus fits perfectly into my tech ecosystem."]},{"l":"Setting up my Range","p":["Ludus' documentation walks through the installation process, and following it is very straightforward so I won't be covering it in this blogpost.","After you have installed Ludus and created a user, you should be able to list the available templates.","On a fresh install, a few default templates are provided but haven't been build yet. As I like to keep things up to date I added a win2025 template, but you can add as many as you like (if the storage lets you).","While browsing the “Environment Guides,” I stumbled upon the Game Of Active Directory – Ninja Hacking Academy (GOAD-NHA) setup. This thing is basically an escape room for sysadmins — you drop in, and everything dares you to figure it out by yourself. But I wanted my cyber range to be on the latest Windows Server version, which at the time of writing is 2025.","That meant modifying the original Ansible scripts. Thankfully, it wasn’t as dramatic as it sounds, but it did feel like giving the templates a well-deserved modern update. My current ludus range configuration looks as follows:","I also made a few tweaks to the available RAM of the VMs and updated the domain/forest functional level to 2025 as well. With this file we can start building our hacker lab.","For the lab I will be building, we also have to change one of the servers to Windows 2022. At the time of writing, the lab cannot be solved because of small changes in the newer versions of Windows."]},{"l":"Ninja Hacker Academy Setup","p":["NHA is designed as an educational challenge where users normally work toward gaining domain admin on two domains ( academy.ninja.lan and ninja.hack).

With Ansible we can provision our whole infrastructure using custom playbooks. Using the available playbooks from Orange-Cyberdefense, I changed most of them to be compatible with the latest version of Ansible.","In the future I was thinking of publishing them on my GitHub, but they might already be there ;)","We proceed with the provisioning and install the required collections (but these should already be installed with ludus):","Before continuing, make sure that your inventory file at workspace/ludus/inventory matches the IP addresses from your range. In my case the range starts with 10.2.10.x so I will update it accordingly:","Hop into the ansible directory where all the playbooks are located and run them all.","If you get the error Ansible could not initialize the preferred locale: unsupported locale setting, check your locales with locale -a and set it with export LC_ALL=YOUR_LOCALE.utf8","Ignore the warnings as Ansible goes brrr...","This will take some time for it to complete — a good opportunity to refresh your coffee while automation does its thing. In case we ever make a change to one of the playbooks or tasks we can also just run a single one:","After it is finished provisioning our lab, we can take snapshots via the proxmox web UI or SSH run the following ludus command (make sure your disks allow snapshots)"]},{"l":"Connecting to the Lab","p":["Copy this file to your client and run WireGuard:","You can optionally narrow AllowedIPs down to only the srv01 host for better isolation. And just like that, you’re securely connected to your newly deployed cyber range. Let's do a quick test with one of the local admin passwords to see if everything works fine."]},{"l":"Final Thoughts","p":["Turning an old desktop into a fully automated Active Directory cyber range has been one of the most satisfying upgrades to my homelab so far. With Proxmox handling the virtualization and Ludus orchestrating everything, I now have a modern, customizable environment for testing scenarios, experimenting with configurations, and learning in a safe space."]}],[{"l":"Active Directory Home Lab with Proxmox - Part 5","p":["Connecting Linux machines to an Active Directory (AD) domain can streamline user authentication and management in mixed-environment networks.

To do this you first make a regular LXC, make a backup and restore it as privileged.","This container will serve as our web server and the machine we'll join to the Active Directory domain."]},{"l":"Installing Necessary Packages","p":["Before joining the domain, you need to install several key packages that facilitate communication and integration with Active Directory. It's always a good practice to ensure your system is up-to-date before installing new software.","First, update and upgrade your existing packages:","Next, install the required packages. These include sssd(System Security Services Daemon) for authentication and identity management, realmd for domain joining, oddjob and oddjob-mkhomedir for home directory creation, adcli for Active Directory command-line tools, samba-common and samba-common-tools for Samba utilities, krb5-workstation for Kerberos authentication, and openldap-clients for LDAP client utilities."]},{"l":"Joining Active Directory","p":["With the necessary packages installed, you can now join your AlmaLinux machine to the Active Directory domain.

SSSD is responsible for handling authentication and identity lookups against Active Directory, while oddjobd(along with oddjob-mkhomedir) helps with tasks like creating home directories for domain users.","Now, edit the PAM configuration for SSH (/etc/pam.d/sshd) to allow SSSD to handle authentication and to enable automatic home directory creation.","Finally, configure the sssd.conf file to specify how SSSD should interact with your Active Directory domain. This file defines the domain settings, default shell, home directory creation, and access providers."]},{"l":"Authenticating with Kerberos and SSH","p":["To enable Kerberos authentication, you need to configure the /etc/krb5.conf file on your local machine. This file tells your system how to locate the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) for your domain.

While its capabilities are impressive, I quickly encountered a common challenge: Windows Defender's detection of beacon payloads on my Windows VM. In order to enhance my red teaming skills, I decided to dig into leveraging a custom stager, DInvoke and FilelessPELoader, together with common evasion techniques for building my own Sliver shellcode loader."]},{"l":"What is a shellcode loader?","p":["A shellcode loader is a small piece of executable code designed to, as its name would suggest, load and execute shellcode (being a larger payload) into a target process's memory. Think of it as the initial delivery mechanism. Shellcode loaders often go along with techniques like process injection, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code within a legitimate process, that bypass traditional security controls focused on executable files on disk.","The loader will act as a Stage 1 payload (e.g. stager.txt). Its primary purpose is to establish communication with a command and control (C2) or payload server and download the larger, more feature-rich (and often encrypted) Stage 2 payload. The second stage payload is the main malicious code that we as an attacker intend to execute on the target system.","Stager diagram","For this blog post our final payload will be a Sliver beacon. The goal is to create a stager with the following properties:","Natively supported by Windows without too much dependencies.","Bypass common defenses found on modern operating systems (e.g. signature checks).","Use commonly whitelisted protocols in order to bypass firewall rules and fit in with normal traffic (e.g. web traffic)."]},{"l":"Sliver Setup","p":["For more information on installing and using Sliver, see the official wiki.","From Sliver v1.5 you can make extensive customizations to the HTTP C2 traffic generated by the server and implant by modifying the HTTP C2 configuration file, which by default is located at ~/.sliver/configs/http-c2.json. To be able to blend in more with normal traffic, I made some minor modifications to this file.","Next, we can generate our HTTPS beacon shellcode with basic obfuscation features enabled.","This command will save the shellcode for our Sliver beacon in /tmp/rev.bin. If you want to generate an executable (default) that will be executed on the target we can use do this as well. After generating the beacon, we start an mTLS listener.","Generating a Sliver beacon and listener","We can convert the executable to a .bin file with Donut. Donut is a tool focused on creating binary shellcodes that can be executed in memory. Its primary strength lies in its ability to convert executables (.exe), dynamic-link libraries (.dll), .NET assemblies, VBScript, and JScript into shellcode. This shellcode can then be injected into a running process, allowing for fileless execution of malicious payloads. I'll use Donut with the -b 1 flag to not add AMSI bypass and the -e 3 flag for encryption.","The idea is that our final stager will grab this binary shellcode file and execute it in memory.

Using DInvoke, we can use Dynamic Invocation to load unmanaged code via DLLs at runtime. The traditional way (using PInvoke) involves the program declaring beforehand which functions it will use, and the operating system helps to link them up. Dynamic Invocation, on the other hand, looks up the address of a function in memory at the exact moment you need it, rather than declaring it beforehand. This makes it harder for analysis since traditional tools will monitor these pre-declared links to see what the program is doing.","DInvoke helps us to avoid API Hooking by calling arbitrary code from memory, while also avoiding detections that look for imports of suspicious API calls via the Import Address Table.

It is a compact and self-contained way to securely transmit data (\"claims\") between server and client as a JSON object. These tokens can be signed using a secret or a public/private key pair. A typical JWT token consists of 3 main parts:","Header: contains algorithm and type","Payload: contains user information","Signature: validates the above portions with a secret key or public/private key pair. Without knowing the server's secret signing key, it should be impossible to generate the correct signature for a given header or payload.","All of these parts are separated by a dot character and base64 encoded, as show in the following example:"]},{"l":"Attacking JWT Tokens","p":["JWT vulnerabilities typically arise due to flawed JWT handling within an application, meaning that the signature of the token is not properly verified. Even if the signature is correctly verified, the trust relies heavily on the security of the secret key."]},{"l":"Improper signature verification","p":["If the server does not properly verify the signature, anyone is able to make arbitrary changes to the content of the token. For example, suppose the JWT contains the following claims:","If the server identifies the session based on the username, modifying its value might enable an attacker to impersonate other logged-in users. Similarly, if the isAdmin value is used for access control, this could provide a simple vector for privilege escalation."]},{"l":"Accepting tokens with no signature","p":["The JWT header contains an alg parameter telling the server which algorithm was used to sign the token. This means that it also tells which algorithm to use when verifying the signature.","JWTs can be signed using a range of different algorithms, but can also be left unsigned. In this case, the alg parameter can be set to none, which indicates a so-called \"unsecured JWT\"."]},{"l":"Algorithm confusion attacks","p":["Algorithm confusion attacks (also known as key confusion attacks) occur when an attacker is able to force the server to verify the signature of a JSON web token using a different algorithm than is intended by the website's developers. This vulnerability typically arises because of a flawed implementation of the token verification. Many libraries make use of a generic method to verify the token that rely on the alg parameter in the JWT header.","Some of the signing algorithms, such as HS256, use a \"symmetric\" key which is a single key to both sign and verify the token. Using a flawed verification process like above enables an attacker to sign the token using HS256 and the public key, where the server will use that same public key to verify the signature. The public key can look something like this:","This means we can make our own JWTs with a forged signature created using the public key and the HS256 algorithm to bypass the authentication completely. Since the JWT was already signed using the public key, the signature verification by the application is successful leading to a successful key confusion attack.","In cases where the public key isn't readily available, you may still be able to test for algorithm confusion by deriving the key from a pair of existing JWTs. This process is relatively simple using tools such as jwt_forgery.py."]},{"l":"JWT header parameter injection","p":["Although only the alg parameter is mandatory, in practice the header often contain other parameters:","jwk: JSON Web Key (can sometimes be exposed on standard endpoints such as /.well-know/jswks.json)","jku: JSON Web Key Set URL for servers to fetch a set of trusted keys","kid: Key ID that servers can use to identify the correct key in cases where there are multiple keys to choose from"]},{"l":"JWK parameter injection","p":["Ideally, servers should only use a limited whitelist of public keys to verify JWT signatures. However, misconfigurations often lead use to use any key that's embedded in the jwk parameter. This makes it possible to sign a modified JWT using your own RSA private key, and then embedding the matching public key in the jwk header. You can see an example of this in the following JWT header:"]},{"l":"JKU parameter injection","p":["The jku parameter points to an endpoint where JWKs are stored used to verify the signature.

The validation is done in the middleware/verification.py.","It uses the signature.py module to encode the payload into a JWT token. The payload does contain the RSA modulus n and the encryption exponent e. With knowledge of these values, we can decode any JWT token to find the original prime factors p and q and break the encryption.","Let's have a look at how we can decode our customer token and modify it to become administrator.","We insert our current user JWT token in our script and run it. This will then print out a new JWT that has the administrator role and should be able to access the admin panel. Further along in the code of app.py there is also an SQL Injection vulnerability in the admindashboard endpoint."]},{"l":"Foothold","p":["Let's perform a search query on the admin dashboard and intercept the request with BurpSuite. We can confirm the SQL Injection by making the server sleep for several seconds.","By using SQLMap we can check our user privileges:","We have FILE permissions, meaning we can read and write arbitrary files. Remember we still have a couple of cron scripts we haven't looked at yet, one of which is the dbmonitor.sh script owned by the mysql user. After we download this file via the same method as before, some things stand out.","If the file dbstatus.json exists and does not conain the string \"database is down\" then it runs a command with /bin/bash, afterwards it deletes the JSON file. This script is ran every minute. The latest_version variable lists the contents of the scripts folder with a wildcard. This script will sort all scripts starting with fixer-v and executes the last matching script (tail). Since we can write files via the SQL injection vulnerability, we can get a reverse shell.","First we create a reverse shell script and run a Python web server.","We create a small script that automates the exploitation. It first grabs our payload, writes it to /data/scripts/fixer-v999 and then writes an empty string to /data/scripts/dbstatus.json in order to execute our payload.","We start a netcat listener on port 9001, run the above script and after a minute we should have received a connection back to our machine."]},{"l":"User"},{"l":"Mysql to www-data","p":["After getting a shell as the mysql we still have very limited access. We can move laterally to the www-data user since there is also a script ( app_backup.sh) that runs every minute by this user. We are able to remove the backup file and replace it with the same reverse shell script.","We again run a netcat listener to catch the shell (it might take a few tries)."]},{"l":"www-data to qa","p":["We can find a password for the qa user in the /var/www/qa_testing/.hg/store/data/app.py.i file.","We can now SSH as qa."]},{"l":"Root"},{"l":"QA to Dev","p":["The qa user can run a command as the dev user.","Looking online this command is used by Mercurial SCM. In our home folder we have a .hgrc file that contains some configuration options. One option of Mercurial is to create hooks that run before/after certain actions. From the Mercurial Docs there is also a hook called post-command that runs after successful invocations of the associated command.","Again we download our shell and modify the .hgrc file to run our shell after a pull request. Next we run a netcat listener and perform the pull request as the dev user.","When running the command, we get a permission denied error so we try another way. From the same documentation, you can also specify the configuration file inside the .hg folder per repository. We can create this file in the /tmp directory and then try to run our exploit again."]},{"l":"Dev to Root","p":["We now have a shell as the dev user that can run rsync as root. Rsync is a tool for synchronizing files and directories between location.","We can exploit this by copying the root user's private SSH key. One quick way to read the root flag or root SSH key is using the following command:","The key element is the --chmod flag of the rsync binary. This additional parameter changes the ownership of the copied file. Since we are the dev user, all files will be copied under our permissions, so this option lets us change the permission of file we copied from the root directory. Now we can copy the SSH key and login as the root user."]}],[{"l":"ProcNet (Hard)"},{"l":"Synopsis","p":["With the increasing use of open-source Command and Control (C2) frameworks by threat actors, it has become crucial for blue teams to develop strategies to detect and mitigate these threats. In this exercise, our red team simulated an attack using a popular open-source C2 framework to help improve defenses. We were provided with PCAP files, EVTX logs, and API traces, which we will analyze to uncover the attack's methodology."]},{"l":"Introduction to Tools and Files","p":["During this investigation, we will use various tools to examine the artifacts:","Wireshark for analyzing the network traffic captured in PCAP files.","API Monitor to track API calls made by malicious executables.","VirusTotal to identify and analyze potential malware.","One of the less familiar file types encountered, .apmx64, is associated with API Monitor, a powerful tool for monitoring and controlling API calls made by applications. This tool was instrumental in understanding the behavior of the malware on the host."]},{"l":"Analyzing the Packet Capture"},{"l":"CSGO Malware Download and Execution","p":["We begin by examining the Employee.pcapng file using Wireshark. Filtering the traffic by the HTTP protocol, we quickly identified a file named csgo.exe being downloaded.","PCAP File Download","The download was completed around 7:22:22 UTC. Following this, the malware attempted to establish a connection with a remote IP address ( 3.6.165.8) over port 443, likely to secure its communications using TLS.","PCAP Malware Connect","This type of communication is typical of C2 servers, where the malware contacts a command server to receive further instructions or to exfiltrate data. To further analyze the server, we extract the JA3 fingerprint from the TLS handshake.","The JA3 fingerprint is a unique identifier generated from the client's TLS configuration, which can be used to detect malicious activity even if the IP address changes.","PCAP Malware C2 JA3"]},{"l":"Identifying the C2 Framework: Sliver Detection","p":["To determine the C2 framework being used, we can extract the csgo.exe binary from the packet capture by following the TCP stream of the HTTP request and exporting the payload. We will then upload this binary to VirusTotal for analysis.","VirusTotal Sliver Detection","VirusTotal identified the binary as associated with the Sliver C2 framework, a popular open-source tool used by both red teams and malicious actors for post-exploitation tasks. Sliver provides various capabilities, including remote command execution, lateral movement, and credential harvesting."]},{"l":"Monitoring API Calls with API Monitor"},{"l":"Accessing Secure Vault Data","p":["The next phase of the investigation involves examining the behavior of the csgo.exe malware on the infected system. Using API Monitor, we can track the API calls made by this process. Early in the execution, the malware retrieved the current working directory using the GetCurrentDirectoryW API call. Shortly afterward, it launched a new process named notepad.exe.","API Monitor Notepad executed","Sliver typically spawns a sacrificial process (often notepad.exe) when using the execute-assembly command, injecting .NET assemblies into the process for execution. This can be changed, but it seems like the defaults were utilized by the operators.","Next, we observe the malware loading the vaultcli.dll module into the notepad.exe process. This library is used to interact with the Windows Credential Manager (often referred to as the Windows Vault), which stores and retrieves user credentials. By loading this DLL, the attacker aimed to enumerate and potentially extract sensitive credentials stored in the vault. API Monitor Vault","The specific API call observed was VaultEnumerateVaults, which lists the available vaults on the system. This suggests the attacker was attempting to identify and access stored credentials, possibly to facilitate lateral movement within the network. Credential theft is a common goal in such attacks, as it allows threat actors to escalate privileges and gain access to additional systems.","API Monitor Enumerating Domain Users","Following the vault enumeration, the attacker initiated another significant action: enumerating domain users. This was done by executing the net.exe utility, a command-line tool used for network administration.","This command lists all members of the \"Domain Admins\" group, which typically has high-level privileges across the domain. Gaining knowledge of these users is crucial for an attacker, as compromising one of these accounts can give them control over the entire domain."]},{"l":"Downloading Additional Malware via WMI","p":["The investigation revealed that after gaining access to domain information, the attacker used WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to download another Sliver beacon, named fifa24.exe, to the Domain Controller (DC).","API Monitor Fifa Download","WMI is a powerful feature in Windows that allows for remote management of systems, including executing commands, scripts, and managing files. The attacker used a tool from the Sliver ARMORY called SharpWMI to download and execute this payload on the DC. This indicates that the attacker had already escalated privileges, likely by compromising a domain admin account retrieved from the Windows Vault, enabling them to execute commands remotely on the DC."]},{"l":"Extracting the NTDS.dit File","p":["One of the most critical actions taken by the attacker was the extraction of the NTDS.dit file. This file contains a database of Active Directory (AD) data, including password hashes for all domain users.","API Monitor NTDS Dump","After the file was retrieved, the attacker compressed it using the Compress-Archive PowerShell command:","Compressing the NTDS.dit file and other related files into a zip archive is a common tactic used to prepare the data for exfiltration. Once the file is compressed, it becomes easier to transfer out of the network, typically over encrypted channels to avoid detection."]},{"l":"Conclusion","p":["In this exercise, we observed a sophisticated attack leveraging the Sliver C2 framework, which included the use of process injection, credential harvesting, remote command execution, and data exfiltration. By understanding the tactics and techniques used, blue teams can better prepare for similar threats in their environments."]},{"l":"Key Takeaways","p":["Use of C2 Frameworks: Open-source C2 frameworks like Sliver are increasingly used by both red teams and malicious actors. Being familiar with their behaviors, such as JA3 fingerprints and typical process injections, is essential for detection.","Credential Theft: The attack demonstrated a focus on accessing and leveraging credentials, particularly through Windows Vault and domain enumeration, underscoring the importance of securing credential stores and monitoring access.","Lateral Movement: The use of WMI to move laterally within the network highlights the need for monitoring such administrative tools for unusual activity.","Data Exfiltration: The extraction and compression of the NTDS.dit file show how attackers can target critical AD components, making it imperative to secure and monitor these assets closely."]}],[{"l":"About","p":["Hi, I'm 0xSerpent — a software and cybersecurity enthusiast with a deep interest in building robust software, understanding networks, and exploring the ever-evolving landscape of digital security.
